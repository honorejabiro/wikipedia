# CSS

CSS is a language that can be used to add style to an [HTML](/wiki/HTML) page.


In publishing and graphic design, Lorem ipsum is a placeholder text commonly 
used to demonstrate the visual form of a document or a typeface without relying 
on meaningful content. Lorem ipsum may be used as a placeholder before the final 
copy is available.
